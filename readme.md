# Highlight Generator Readme

EXE file is on the way! So far, this can only be run from python, but I'm trying
my best to create an accessible file for everyone.

This program takes clips in the 'clips' directory and combine them into a replay. Currently, this replay is called 'replay.mp4' and is found in the 'finished' directory. The audio of the file is chosen from one of the songs in 'soundtracks' directory. So far, the track is randomly chosen, but hopefully other functionality will soon be added. After the clip is generated, the clips can be deleted using the onscreen prompts.
